# Japan Travel Tag Icon Assets

This folder contains small transparent PNG illustrations for the Japan 2026 travel planner. They are intended as lead icons for tags, labels, chips, itinerary cards, empty states, and compact metadata rows.

## Style

- Format: transparent PNG
- Size: 256x256 px
- Default visual language: soft Japanese travel illustration, navy outlines, red accents, pale-blue shadows, warm cream highlights
- Generic visual language: same navy/red/blue illustration system, but without Japan-specific motifs
- Best display size: 18-32 px for chips/labels, 40-64 px for empty states or larger card accents
- Intended pairing: icon + short text label, such as `Food`, `Booked`, or `Budget`

## Theme Packs

Two matching theme packs are available:

| Theme | Filename Pattern | Use When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Japan-specific | `tag-food.png`, `tag-booked.png` | The planner should feel tailored to the Japan trip |
| Generic travel | `tag-food-generic.png`, `tag-booked-generic.png` | The planner needs a less destination-specific theme |

The generic files preserve the same semantic names and suggested uses as the default files, with `-generic` added before `.png`.

## Implementation Notes For Codex

- These icons already include transparency. Do not add a background unless the UI needs one.
- Prefer using them as decorative `img` elements with meaningful nearby text, not as the only accessible label.
- Good default CSS for chips:

```css
.tag-icon {
  width: 1.25rem;
  height: 1.25rem;
  object-fit: contain;
  flex: 0 0 auto;
}
```

- In Vite/React, public assets can be referenced with `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`, for example `${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}assets/icons/tag-food.png`.
- Generic theme assets use the same path pattern, for example `${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}assets/icons/tag-food-generic.png`.
- The existing app also uses lucide icons. Use these PNGs where a warmer illustrated tag style is desired, and lucide icons where controls/actions need compact symbol clarity.
